# Code for finding smallest and largest critical sets in Latin squares (scs and lcs)

The concept of "critical sets in Latin squares" was invented by John Nelder in 1977, in a CSIRO publication.

The smallest and largest critical sets can be written as functions of the order of the Latin square "n".
So, although Nelder did not give a conjecture about "scs(n)" and "lcs(n)", we may guess that his conjecture was
scs(n) = floor(n^2/4) and lcs(n) = (n^2-n)/2.

Stinson and van Rees wrote a 1982 article on "Some Large Critical Sets" which showed critical sets of order 9 and size 39, and order 10 and size 55.
In my PhD (1998-2001) I found critical sets of order 9/size 44, order 10/size 57, order 11/size 70, order 12/size 90, order 14/size 118 and in 2002 I found a critical sets of order 9 and size 45.

The question is can we improve on that "lcs" bound? I would expect my conjecture from Bean and Mahmoodian is true -- lcs(n) â‰¤ n^2 - 3^(log_2 n)

So this would imply 
```
25 <= lcs(7) <= 27
lcs(8) = 37
45 <= lcs(9) <= 48
57 <= lcs(10) <= 61
70 <= lcs(11) <= 76
90 <= lcs(12) <= 92
95 <= lcs(13) <= 110 (30 November 2024, see below)
118 <= lcs(14) <= 130
146 <= lcs(15) <= 151
lcs(16) = 175
```
etc. (Does OEIS A080572 give a construction for a critical set of order 2^n+1?)

I would guess that lcs(7) = 25 - interesting question is how many of the 147 main classes of order 7 Latin squares have a critical set of size 25 -- in my thesis, I found 113 main classes with such critical sets.

So what can we do for lcs(9), lcs(10), lcs(11) etc?
